I am Akash Mehra, a Machine Learning Engineer. This is my personal blog<sup>*</sup> where I
write about my learnings in the field of Machine Learning and Artifical
Intelligence. I am very passionate about math and its applications and usually
find myself reading math theory in my free time. I love playing football and
cricket when I am not working, reading, sleeping or working out.
